    - Create a Pull Request (PR):
        1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
        2. You’ll see a “Compare & Pull Request” button.
        3. Click it → write a meaningful title and description of your work.
        4. Select base branch = main and compare branch = your branch.
        5. Submit the PR.
    - Code Review Process:
        Other collaborators can:
            Review your PR.
            Add comments or suggest changes.
            Approve or request modifications.
            You can update your branch (e.g., fix comments) and push again:
                git add .
                git commit -m "Fixed review comments"
                git push
    - Merge the Pull Request
        Once approved:
            Click Merge Pull Request on GitHub.
            Optionally, delete the branch after merging to keep things clean.
    - Sync Your Local Repo
        After merges happen on main:
            git checkout main
            git pull origin main
        This ensures your local copy is up to date before creating a new branch.
